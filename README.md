# ClassificationUsingScikitLearn
Learn to learn with scikit-learn. 
nn_otto_ensemble_v8.6.py was one of our best attempts for the Kaggle otto project as team BoilerUp. We used an ensemble of 4 models: a random forest model, a gradient boosting model, a neural network model, and a support vector classifier model. We used nolearn and lasagne for the neural network model, and scikit-learn for the other three models. Data and description of the problem can be obtained at:
